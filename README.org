#+TITLE: Advent of Code 2020

These are my solutions to Advent of Code 2020. Don't expect the code to be any
good - I'm using this as an opportunity to learn Haskell.

* Building
  If you want to try these solutions for yourself (for some reason), you can
  use Nix to build binaries for all the challenges using `nix-build`.

* License
  All code here is licensed under the Unlicense - do whatever you want with this
  code.
